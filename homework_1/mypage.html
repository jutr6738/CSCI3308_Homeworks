        <h1>Troni, Julia</h1>
        <p>I was born and raised in Littleton, Colorado. I have 3 younger siblings and a dog with a thriving instagram account @KylieThePoopie. I love to hike, spend time outside, and workout. I am studying computer science at CU Boulder because it is very applicable in many senarios and I am interested in solving problems and maximizing efficiency. </p>
